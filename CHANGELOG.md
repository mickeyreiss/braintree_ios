## 3.7.0 (2015-03-02)

* Refactor and improve SSL Pinning code
* Update PayPal Mobile SDK to new version (PayPal-iOS-SDK 2.8.4-bt1) that does not include card.io.
  * :rotating_light: Please note! :rotating_light:  

      This change breaks builds that depend on a workaround introduced in 3.4.0 that added card.io headers to fix [card.io duplicate symbol issues](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/53). 

      Since card.io is not officially part of the Braintree API, and since the headers were only included as part of a workaround for use by a small group of developers, this potentially-breaking change is not accompanied by a major version release. 

      If your build breaks due to this change, you can re-add card.io to your project's Podfile: 

          pod 'CardIO', '~> 4.0'`

      And adjust your card.io imports to:

          #import <CardIO/CardIO.h>

## 3.6.1 (2015-02-24)

  * Make Apple Pay a build option, enabled via `Braintree/Apple-Pay` subspec,
    which adds a `BT_ENABLE_APPLE_PAY=1` preprocesor macro.
    * Addresses an issue [reported by developers attempting to submit v.zero integrations without Apple Pay to the app store](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/60).

  * Minor updates to UK localization
  * Expose a new `status` property on `BTPaymentProvider`, which exposes the current status of payment method creation (Thanks, @Reflejo!)
