# Braintree/Core

This subspec provides the rest of the SDK with shared functionality
that is generally useful for communicating with Braintree's servers.

This section of the codebase is not intended for general consumption
as it requires intimate understanding of the internals of Braintree.

For general information about getting started with Braintree, please
see our [Hello Client
guide](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/ios/start).
